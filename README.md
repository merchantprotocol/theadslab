These discussions are where you can share suggestions for how the products should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the AdsLab product team. Check out [Making suggestions](#making-suggestions) to learn how to provide feedback.

This repository works in conjunction with the [AdsLab public roadmap](https://github.com/merchantprotocol/theadslab/projects?type=beta), which is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Discussion categories have been established for specific features listed above, as well as a general category for other topics. Additional categories may be added in the future. In the meantime, topics outside of the listed categories above, will be transferred into the general category. Please review the [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating in discussions.

## Making suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/merchantprotocol/theadslab/discussions/) if you have suggestions for how we can improve our products. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion. We are hoping to foster productive and collaborative conversations, so please check out [how to give good feedback](https://github.com/merchantprotocol/theadslab/discussions/3) if you want some guidance on how to kick off a successful discussion.

Prior to making a new discussion, please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already brought to our attention your suggestions. If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion.

### From a suggestion to a shipped feature

Once you kick off a discussion, the Ads Lab product team will evaluate the feedback but will not be able to respond to every submission. From there, we will work with you, and the entire community, to ensure we understand the current capabilities The Ads Lab doesn‚Äôt have and explore the space for potential solutions to your problem statement:

- If the product team determines that we are going to prioritize a feature to solve the problem you've identified, we may open an issue and track its development in the [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/merchantprotocol/projects/3/views/1).
- If the product team determines that we will not be working to solve the problem you have identified, we may comment on the discussion describing our reasoning so our decisions can remain transparent.

# The Ads Lab public roadmap

:sparkle: View the [official Ads Lab public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/merchantprotocol/projects/3)[^1]

Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via [The Ads Lab public feedback discussions](https://github.com/merchantprotocol/theadslab/discussions). 

This repository is for communicating The Ads Lab's roadmap. We‚Äôre planning to iterate on the format of the roadmap itself, and we see potential to engage more in discussions about the future of The Ads Lab's products and features. If you have feedback about this roadmap repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know through [general feedback in The Ads Lab public feedback discussions](https://github.com/merchantprotocol/theadslab/discussions/categories/open-discussion-forum).

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases. 

- A **feature area** that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas, see above.

- A **feature** that indicates the feature or product to which the item belongs. For a list of current features, see below. 

- One or more **product SKU** labels that indicate which product SKUs we expect the feature to be available in. For a list of current product SKUs, see below.

- Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant changelog post.

## Release phases

Release phases indicate the stages that the product or feature goes through, from early testing to general availability.

- **alpha:** *Primarily for testing and feedback*\
Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement. Features still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation, SLAs or support provided.

- **beta:** *Publicly available in full or limited capacity*\
Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually published. No SLAs or support provided.

- **ga:** *Generally available to all customers*\
Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations. Approximately 1-2 quarters from Beta.

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows: 

- **in design:**\
Feature in discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out _how_.

- **exploring:**\
Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.  You'll also find an **Exploratory** column, which is used in conjunction with the **in design** and **exploring** release phase labels for when no timeframe is yet available.

The Ads Lab has major releases on a quarterly basis, and minor releases on a weekly basis. Once we know what version we are delivering a feature, we will update the issue to indicate that information.

## Feature Areas

The following is a list of our current product areas:

- **devops:** DevOps (Server, Databases)
- **analytics:** Identity Resolution Analytics (Matomo, Integrations, Sync)
- **email:** Cold Email Remarketing (Sending Reputation, ESP, SMTP, Campaigns, etc)

## Feature

The following is a list of our current features and products, with distinct labels for filtering:

- **identity:** Identity Resolution
- **identity-ai:** Lead & Traffic scoring
- **email-campaigns:** Email Content
- **email-esp:** Email Sending Server

_More labels will be added in the future as needed._

## Product SKUs

- **all:** Available to all users, including a free tier. Different SKUs may have different levels of functionality.
- **adslab team:** The Ads Lab Team
